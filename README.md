In this application I learned how to create a "Spring Boot" project from the zero. 
I implemented for the first time "Spring Boot Security". Respectively it comes with authentication form which it was impelemnted and of course with logout method.
Also here you cand find how I implemented @OneToOne and @OneToMany relationships between enteties, implementation of conectivity with MySQL database and JavaScript and JQuery requests which came from front end. Js files and html files are saved on "resources" pakage from project. 
I learned how connect my application to SMTP server (Google server) for sending emails to users.

About application.
It's a social network site for those who are passionate about motorcycles. 
Each user when registering is obliged to register their motorcycle. The user can post a travel intention and the area through which he will ride. Other users seeing the post and commenting on it can join. Thus, a group of motorcyclists is organized who can travel together or post pictures from a certain trip and share impressions.
